# Oktoberfest Frenzy Catching Game

**Oktoberfest Frenzy** is an interactive web-based game where players catch falling objects (pretzels and beers) during an Oktoberfest celebration. The goal is to catch as many pretzels and beers as possible while avoiding missing more than 3 objects!

This game was created as a fun way to practice **event listeners** in JavaScript, focusing on real-time interactions, keypress handling, and dynamic DOM manipulation. You might be wondering—why an Oktoberfest theme? Well, it's October, this year's edition is coming to an end, and as a fan of the event (controversial, I know!), I thought it would be the perfect inspiration. I had a blast coding and playing this game, and I hope you enjoy it too!
